 <p>The Avocado Eco Organic Mattress and other beds from Avocado, including the Eco Green, Vegan and Luxury Organic, are all certified organic with GOLS-certified latex and GOTS-certified cotton. They were certified by a third-party organization who subjects brands to high environmental and social standards, from the beginning to the end of the supply chain, starting with the farms they source their materials from to the factories that manufacture the beds. The only part of this bed that isnâ€™t natural is the non-woven polypropylene fabric used to wrap the pocketed coils.</p>
